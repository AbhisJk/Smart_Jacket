Patient Monitoring System

Our proposed system consists of a NodeMCU, a Raspberry Pi, a heartbeat sensor, a temperature sensor. In our proposed framework, the heartrate and body temperature are automatically sensed, the readings are recorded continuously. Finally, after processing the collected data, these data are sent to the server through the existing Local Area Network. The doctors can check the health condition parameter through a web application.
